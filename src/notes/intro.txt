RTL philosophy ->
"The more your tests resembles the way your software is used, the more confidance they can give you"

CRA provides Jest and RTL out of the box.

by default 'npm test' runs Jest in watch mode.

test structure=>

testDescription= "any text to properly describe what is the test case"
testExpectation = ()=>{
    // a call back function where test is asserted
    expect().matcherFunction()
}
timeOut = 5s (default value)

test(testDescription,testExpectation, timeout)

test or it both mean same.

jest is provided globally by default, so no need to import specifically.
